# Disussion Type Questions

If you don't have a lot of programming experience, your interviewer might ask questions like the ones below. They don't involve programming, but they do require that you understand *programming* languages. Having a good understanding of these topics is an important component of writing, reviewing, and debugging code well.

1. What is the difference between a statically and dynamically typed programming language?
2. What is the difference between the stack & heap?
3. What is a garbage collected language? What is an example of a language that isn't garbage collected?


Note: It's also a good idea to have an idea of the different places data can be fetched from and its associated latencies:
- cache (there's technically multiple "levels" of the cache)
- main memory
- disk
- the network

Accessing data in from any one of these locations is several orders of magnitude slower than the previous.
