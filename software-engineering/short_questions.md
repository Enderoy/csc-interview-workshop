1. Given a string, determine if it consists only of unique characters or not.
2. You are given a url with request parameters `https://animals.com/search?whiskers=true&legs=4&furry=true&weight=30.3`. Parse the request parameters into a dictionary.
3. You are given an array of numbers `A` and a target `t`. Determine if there is a pair of numbers `a` and `b` in the array such that `a + b = t`.
4. You are given a non-empty string consisting only of the characters `)` and `(`. Examples are `((()))`, `()()()(())`, `(()()(((`, `)()(`. Determine if the string is valid (i.e., that the brackets close in the correct order). In the previous examples, the first two strings are valid, the last two are not.
