It's really important to understand the company you're accepting an offer with&mdash;and the team you're joining. Here are some questions that are you might want to ask your recruiter or potential manager. Don't hesitate to ask to set up a separate 20-30 minute chat with them!

### Structure
- Will I have a dedicated mentor to work with? Will I have weekly 1:1s with my mentor/manager?
  - *The less experience you have programming, the more important it is for the answer to both these questions to be "yes"*.
- What would my first two weeks at $company look like?
- What is your work from home/sick leave policy?

### The Team
- How big is the team? what is the structure/role people have?
- Have other interns worked on the team before? / Have other interns worked with *my mentor* before?
- What are some examples of projects I could work on? Examples of projects previous interns have worked on?
- For this internship, I want to learn more about full stack web development and gain experience in Ruby (say). How will my work at your company help me with that?

### The Company
- What proportion of $company comes from an underrepresented minority?

### Technology
- What technologies/languages do you use?
